# Buckling Laboratory

## Overview
This project explores how various material and length rods buckle under tensile end-load.  
Experiments results are compared to theory.

## Goals
- Learn basics of Euler buckling  
- Measure critical loads  
- Compare results with models  

## Files
- `data/` → measurements  
- `scripts/` → MATLAB/Python analysis  
- `docs/` → documentaion of results
